create backend url for the app.
export const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';

create constants for each of urls.

export const GET_BLOG_DATA{
  url: 'blog-posts',
  method: 'GET',
}

utils->makeRequest.ts  

const makeRequest = async (
  apiEndpoint: {url: string;method: string},
  dynamicConfig ={}// some of apis like get dont require data but some like post will
) => {
  const requestDetails = {
    method: apiEndpoint.method,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    ...dynamicConfig,
  };
  const {data} = await axios(
    `${BACKEND_URL}/${apiEndpoint.url}`,
    requestDetails,
  );
  }
}

We need to write tests as well :|
mock the utils and return mock data.

CORS:
Cross origin resource sharing.
We need to allow the request from the frontend to the backend.
We can do this by adding a middleware in the backend.

npm i cors

import cors from 'cors';
app.use(cors());

Now we can make the request from the frontend to the backend.
CORS is only mechanism defined by web browsers so curl or postman will still allow the request.
